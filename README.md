| **Spoofed Sender**     | Email domain is `netfliix-billing.com` (misspelled "Netflix").              |
| **Suspicious Link**    | Link appears legitimate but redirects to a fake domain.                     |
| **Urgent Language**    | Uses fear ("account is on hold") to pressure user into immediate action.    |
| **Social Engineering** | Poses as a trusted service (Netflix) to exploit user trust.                 |
| **Grammar Issues**     | Domain spelling mistake ("Netfliix") indicates a lack of professionalism.   |
